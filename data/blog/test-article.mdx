## Plan

- traditional error handling: exceptions and catching
    - example of a piece of code that does 3 chained calls
- drawbacks of such approach
    - no compile time verification of error handling
    - hard to follow for programmer and for runtime (context switch)
- introducing arrow's [Either](https://arrow-kt.io/docs/apidocs/arrow-core/arrow.core/-either/)
- core principles / concepts
  - similarity with c functions that can return an error code
  - monad: a data structure that allow to combine function while adding some effect (in this case, the effect is error handling / short circuiting)
  - right biased disjunction
  - right vs left
  - flatMap method
  - map / mapLeft
  - recovering from errors
  - finally
- usage
  - typealias + base error type
  - recovering from errors
  - combining either results
  - integrating with the rest of the world: Exception -> Either and Either -> Exception

TODO small intro?

## Error handling
Error handling is an important aspect of software development,
as it allows developers to gracefully handle and recover from errors that may occur during the execution of a program.
An error is defined as anything that makes it impossible to continue and finish the current computation or function.
At that moment, we must stop the current computation (this is called "short circuiting") and return an error to the caller.

When an error occurs, the calling code usually wants to perform either one of the following tasks:
- Stop the current computation and let the error bubble up, optionally returning a new error instead of the original error
- Gracefully handle the error by either ignoring it, logging it or performing an alternative computation to compensate for the error

## Exceptions

In languages such as Java and Kotlin, the most common way of handling errors is via exceptions and `try` / `catch` blocks.
Any function or method can at any moment throw an exception: 
An exception object containing information about the error (error message, error code, stack trace) is created on the spot and thrown to the caller.
The current executing function will be stopped at the place the error was thrown,
and the exception will "bubble up" the stack frame, stopping all caller functions, until it is caught (or until it terminates the program ðŸ¥²).

However, this approach has some drawbacks:
- It's not always clear wether a function will throw an exception or not (at least in Kotlin).
You basically have to read the code or the documentation of the function in order to understand which exceptions can be thrown.
It's very easy to forget to catch an exception and let it bubble up by mistake.
- In Java specifically, the `throws` keyword allows to declare the exceptions that a method will throw.
The compiler will then check that those exceptions are either declared on the caller or caught in a `catch` block.
This approach makes it very verbose to declare and handle exceptions.
By trying to address the first problem (lack of clarity of which exception is thrown), the opposite problem was created (handling exceptions is now too verbose).
- In some cases, throwing exceptions can cause performance [issues](https://www.baeldung.com/java-exceptions-performance).
This is because creating the stack trace contained in the exception object is an expansive operation in term of time. 

But guess what? We are not tied to use exceptions. Exceptions are just one of multiple ways of handling errors.

## Another approach: Either






```kotlin
sealed class Either<out A, out B>
data class Left<out A>(val value: A) : Either<A, Nothing>()
data class Right<out B>(val value: B) : Either<Nothing, B>()
```



Here is an example of how exceptions are typically used in Kotlin / Java:

```kotlin
fun tryAlternativePaymentMethod(req: PaymentRequest): PaymentResult { /*...*/ }

fun validateAndProcessPayment(req: PaymentRequest): PaymentResult {
  // fetch account from request account id. If account is null, throw an exception
  val account = accountService.getAccount(req.accountId) ?: throw AccountNotFoundException(req.accountId)

  // fetch balance from account balance id. If balance is null, throw an exception
  val balance = balanceService.getBalance(account.balanceId) ?: throw BalanceNotFoundException(req.accountId)

  // if balance is not enough, throw an exception
  if (balance.amount < req.amount) {
    throw InsufficientBalanceException(account.balanceId)
  }
  // try processing the payment and return the result
  // this can throw a PaymentException
  return paymentProcessingService.processPayment(req)
}

fun processPayment(req: PaymentRequest): PaymentResult {
  return try {
    validateAndProcessPayment(req)
  } catch (e: Exception) {
    when (e) {
      // throw a different exception in case of not found
      is AccountNotFoundException, is BalanceNotFoundException -> throw CannotProcessPaymentException(e)
      // try alternative payment method if processPaymentFails
      is PaymentException -> tryAlternativePaymentMethod(req)
      // if not, just rethrow exception
      else -> throw e
    }
  }
}
```
